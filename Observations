Crime Type Trend between 2019-2020:
  Between 2019 and 2020, there was generally a great downward trend in assault & battery, burglary from vehicles, and domestic abuse in the city of LA. On the contrary, there was a slight upward trend in assault with deadly weapon and more concerningly, a noticable upward trend in stolen vehicles with roughly an increase of 5,000 reported cases in 2020.
  In 2019, the the peak month of stolen vehicles was December at roughly 1,450 reported cases and the lowest point was the month of June at only about 300 cases. On the contrary, in 2020, the lowest point for stolen vehicles was in February with about 1,300 reported cases and the trend rose greatly from there with its peak being June with about 2,100 reported cases. This could be due to the fact that during the COVID-19 outbreak, people in LA had to remain inside their home for extended periods of time which led to a general neglect on their vehicles and allowed criminals to have more opportunities to tamper and steal with.
