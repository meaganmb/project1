Crime Type Trend between 2019-2020:
  Between 2019 and 2020, there was generally a great downward trend in assault & battery, burglary from vehicles, and domestic abuse in the city of LA. On the contrary, 
  there was a slight upward trend in assault with deadly weapon and more concerningly, a noticable upward trend in stolen vehicles with roughly an increase of 5,000 reported cases in 2020.
  In 2019, the the peak month of stolen vehicles was December at roughly 1,450 reported cases and the lowest point was the month of June at only about 300 cases. On the contrary, in 2020, 
  the lowest point for stolen vehicles was in February with about 1,300 reported cases and the trend rose greatly from there with its peak being June with about 2,100 reported cases. This 
  could be due to the fact that during the COVID-19 outbreak, people in LA had to remain inside their home for extended periods of time which led to a general neglect on their vehicles and 
  allowed criminals to have more opportunities to tamper and steal with. 

  The graph and table shown on 'Victim Age' depict the number of cases recorded involving a victim of a certain age group. From the data gathered, many inputs into the ‘Victim Age’ category were either 
  -1 or 0, to which we will be assuming is either a typo or an input for ‘not available’. It was not omitted from the dataframe due to the sheer amount of zeros and -1’s that were in the raw 
  data. We can see that 2020 had less crimes overall than 2019, so with the exception of the recorded NA value, it can be shown that crimes decreased within all victim age groups. It can be 
  inferred that this is due to the lockdown regulations that were enforced in los angeles during the covid pandemic in 2020. If we look further into the graph, we can see the most significant 
  percentage difference between the years is shown to be in the age group of 1-18 with a 42.7% decrease in crimes involving victims 1 to 18 years of age. This can also be assumed to be a result 
  of the lockdown regulations, in addition to the less freedom that 1-18 year olds tend to have compared to other age groups and the social necessity of school during those ages to which they 
  used at-home virtual classrooms during the lockdown period.

  From the overall trends shown by the group thus far, there was a decline in crime cases in 2020. Despite the overall decrease, there was an increase in victims from some demographics such as Filipono, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese.
  Looking at the victim descent in the data, the crime victims comprised of mainly Hispanics, Whites and Black.
  From the data we observed that most crime victims were Hispanics im 2019 and 2020, making up about 45% of victims in 2019 and 36% in 2020.
  In 2019 the most common cases for Hispanics were battery/ simple assault which was about 18% of crimes. However despite the dip of crimes during the 2020 covid year, battery/simple assault remained to be the most common case.

Based on the crime reported overall within the areas of Los Angeles the crime decreased in 2020. This could be due to the fact that because of the pandemic less people were outside and maintained 
indoors that criminal activity decreased. People actually listened to the stay at home orders so there was no place to commit crime at usual spots that used to be open at the time such as
streets, malls, parks, etc. One area in particular did increase for crimes reported from 2019 to 2020 and that was the southeast area.
The crime trend for most areas when comparing 2019 and 2020, we did see the one crime that did increase was stolen vehicles. This could be due to the fact that many
people did infact stay indoors while those whom did not obey the orders were stealing cars, therefor seeing a spike of stolen vehicle cases because not many people were utilizing their vehicles.
