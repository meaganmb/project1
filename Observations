Crime Type Trend between 2019-2020:
  Between 2019 and 2020, there was generally a great downward trend in assault & battery, burglary from vehicles, and domestic abuse in the city of LA. On the contrary, 
  there was a slight upward trend in assault with deadly weapon and more concerningly, a noticable upward trend in stolen vehicles with roughly an increase of 5,000 reported cases in 2020.
  In 2019, the the peak month of stolen vehicles was December at roughly 1,450 reported cases and the lowest point was the month of June at only about 300 cases. On the contrary, in 2020, 
  the lowest point for stolen vehicles was in February with about 1,300 reported cases and the trend rose greatly from there with its peak being June with about 2,100 reported cases. This 
  could be due to the fact that during the COVID-19 outbreak, people in LA had to remain inside their home for extended periods of time which led to a general neglect on their vehicles and 
  allowed criminals to have more opportunities to tamper and steal with. 

  The graph and table shown on 'Victim Age' depict the number of cases recorded involving a victim of a certain age group. From the data gathered, many inputs into the ‘Victim Age’ category were either 
  -1 or 0, to which we will be assuming is either a typo or an input for ‘not available’. It was not omitted from the dataframe due to the sheer amount of zeros and -1’s that were in the raw 
  data. We can see that 2020 had less crimes overall than 2019, so with the exception of the recorded NA value, it can be shown that crimes decreased within all victim age groups. It can be 
  inferred that this is due to the lockdown regulations that were enforced in los angeles during the covid pandemic in 2020. If we look further into the graph, we can see the most significant 
  percentage difference between the years is shown to be in the age group of 1-18 with a 42.7% decrease in crimes involving victims 1 to 18 years of age. This can also be assumed to be a result 
  of the lockdown regulations, in addition to the less freedom that 1-18 year olds tend to have compared to other age groups and the social necessity of school during those ages to which they 
  used at-home virtual classrooms during the lockdown period.
